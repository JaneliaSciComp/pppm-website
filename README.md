## Summary
This repository contains the PatchPerPix website. 

## Configuration

This system depends on the [Centralized Config](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/Centralized_Config) system, and
will use the following configurations:
- rest_services
- servers

The location of the configuration system is in the config.cfg file as CONFIG.
If the config service is not available, provide a list of body mappings in api/pppm_bodies.json.

## Deployment

Clone the repo to the deployment system:
```
git clone https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/pppm-website.git
```

To start the app:
```
cd /opt/flask/pppm-website
sh restart_production.sh
```

## Development

To run without docker:
```
cd api
python3 ppp_responder.py
```
If you don't have all of the required modules, it's recommended that you create a virtual environment and install them from requirements.txt.
